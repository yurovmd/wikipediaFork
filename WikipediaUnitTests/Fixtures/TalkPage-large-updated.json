I wish to discuss the 'good faith table' that I had deleted yesterday and you restored, as well as the statement that the 'on-the-minute' announcement will not happen '1 in 3 times'.   I have just called the AMC voice announcer 12 times, spacing my calls over the 60-second between minutes, and always heard the 'on-the-minute'.  (I did this before the original posting as well, along with checking with the equipment setup specialist, just to be sure.)  As I indicated in my comment yesterday, we changed our system several years ago - specifically to fix this issue and others.   If you don't believe this posting, let me suggest you try telephoning the time announcer a few times. I can give you my telephone number but I sense that is not how things are done.  If you find the time announcer is not as I described it, I'd like to know that - so we can fix it!<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>usnochiefscientist (my wiki account) — Preceding <a href='./Wikipedia:Signatures' title='Wikipedia:Signatures'>unsigned</a> comment added by <a href='./User:199.211.133.254' title='User:199.211.133.254'>199.211.133.254</a> (<a href='./User_talk:199.211.133.254' title='User talk:199.211.133.254'>talk</a> • <a href='./Special:Contributions/199.211.133.254' title='Special:Contributions/199.211.133.254'>contribs</a>)<br><br> Hello there!

Thanks for the concern.   As for capitalizing the 's' in 'Time Service' - in this case it is a compound word (like 'United States').  USNO has a 'Time Service' department.

I'd just like to let you know that the section I removed from the page '<a href='./Non-English_versions_of_The_Simpsons' title='Non-English versions of The Simpsons'>Non-English versions of The Simpsons</a>' was spam and false information. In Ireland, The Simpsons is always shown in English with no Irish dub or subtitles. They don't show the German dub either. The episodes are always shown unaltered and none of them are skipped. The source linked is an article about an <i>Arabic</i> version of The Simpsons, not an Irish one, Proof that it's vandalism. I have never even heard of an Irish article until I saw the article. There's no need for one because everyone in Ireland speaks English and would therefor get the jokes. All this is coming from a person living in Ireland who's a fan of the show. The show is actually quite popular here despite what the page says. Please revert my edit. If you don't, I will. --<a href='./Special:Contributions/109.79.55.74' title='Special:Contributions/109.79.55.74'>109.79.55.74</a> (<a href='./User_talk:109.79.55.74' title='User talk:109.79.55.74'>talk</a>) 20:57, 7 August 2014 (UTC)"

Based on user feedback, the buttons are now labeled with simple words (like 'Cancel' or 'Done') instead of potentially confusing icons (like '&lt;' or 'X').  Many of the buttons to edit links, images, and other items now also show the linked page, image name, or other useful information when you click on them.<ul><li><b>Hidden HTML comments</b> (notes visible to editors, but not to readers) can now be read, edited, inserted, and removed.  A small icon (a white exclamation mark on a dot) marks the location of each comments.  You can click on the icon to see the comment.</li><li>You can now <b>drag and drop text</b> and templates as well as images.  A new placement line makes it much easier to see where you are dropping the item.  Images can no longer be dropped into the middle of paragraphs.</li><li><b>All references and footnotes (</b><b>&lt;ref&gt;</b><b> tags) are now made through the '⧼visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label⧽' menu</b>, including the '⧼visualeditor-dialogbutton-reference-tooltip⧽' (manual formatting) footnotes and the ability to re-use an existing citation, both of which were previously accessible only through the 'Insert' menu.  The '⧼visualeditor-dialogbutton-referencelist-tooltip⧽' is still added via the 'Insert' menu.</li><li>When you add an image or other media file, you are now prompted to add an <b>image caption</b> immediately. You can also replace an image whilst keeping the original caption and other settings.</li><li>All tablet users visiting the <b>mobile web</b> version of Wikipedias will be able to opt-in to a version of VisualEditor from 14 August.  You can test the new tool by choosing the beta version of the mobile view in the Settings menu.</li><li>The <b>link tool</b> has a new 'Open' button that will open a linked page in another tab so you can make sure a link is the right one.</li><li>The <b>'Cancel' button</b> in the toolbar has been removed based on user testing.

First off, I'd like to formally <a href='./Wikipedia:WELCOME' title='Wikipedia:WELCOME'>welcome you to Wikipedia</a>. I've left some useful links on your <a href='./User_talk:Liaobuqi' title='User talk:Liaobuqi'>talk page</a> that may assist you in getting more familiar with our environment. Wikipedia is a rewarding collaborative community and I'm happy to see you here.<br><br> Looks like you've already figured out how to supply an <a href='./Help:Edit_summary' title='Help:Edit summary'>edit summary</a> with your changes. While we prefer to always use an edit summary, it is really only pertinent when making what may appear to be controversial changes. In your case, removal a large of amount of <a href='./Wikipedia:CITE' title='Wikipedia:CITE'>sourced material</a>. That being said, I think your rationale for removal is perfectly valid and thank you for taking the time to explain it.<br><br> You asked how to apply your changes without having to redo them from scratch. Perhaps you are not familiar with the concept of a <a href='./Help:Diff' title='Help:Diff'>diff</a>, which is the record of a change made to a page. Every change made can be restored in part or full. If you check the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josh_Howard&amp;action=history'>page history</a>, you'll see your work. The diff you were referring to is probably <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josh_Howard&amp;diff=620814386&amp;oldid=620330290'>this one</a>, by viewing it you could simply copy and paste your work to the current version of the article. There is also the concept of <a href='./Help:Undo' title='Help:Undo'>undoing changes</a>. Here I reverted your work in a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josh_Howard&amp;diff=620814832&amp;oldid=620814451'>single edit</a>, so you could have also undone my edit and supplied the edit summary that way. Careful of not misusing it, the undo function can be quite handy.<br><br> Thanks again for helping improve Wikipedia. If you need any help moving forward don't hesitate to ask. — <b><a href='./User:MusikAnimal' title='User:MusikAnimal'>MusikAnimal</a> <sup><a href='./User_talk:MusikAnimal' title='User talk:MusikAnimal'>talk</a></sup></b> 03:34, 14 August 2014 (UTC)"

Both of them were editing and improving an article, X editor thought to change its citation style from {{<a href='./Template:Cite' title='Template:Cite'>cite</a>}} to {{<a href='./Template:Sfn' title='Template:Sfn'>Sfn</a>}}. And X editor started changing it being WP:Bold. Suddenly Y editor reverted the change with an edit summary <i>WP:CITEVAR and WP:CONSENSUS</i>. X editor started a thread for consensus at it's talk page. Y editor was having a disagreement with X editor. Although the article looks like a mess and have heavy citation clutter with {{<a href='./Template:Cite' title='Template:Cite'>Cite</a>}} but still Y editor supported using {{<a href='./Template:Cite' title='Template:Cite'>Cite</a>}} with reasons like, Newbies will not understand how {{<a href='./Template:Sfn' title='Template:Sfn'>Sfn</a>}} works. Suddenly another newbie came in and supported editor X. Y editor almost confused and can't handle the situation, he left messages at two admins talk page (Both the admins were good friends of Y editor) and started calling them at the articles talk page for discussion although both the admins have no relation with the article (never have edited that page). Y editor explained one of the admin at the admins talk page that X editor is an inexperienced newbie (X editor helped 1 article to meet GA, 1 article to meet FL and have started 3 DYKs). One of the admin came and took the side of Y editor and accused X editor for WP:BATTLE. I have tried my best to explain the case, now the question arises who is correct, X editor or Y editor?? Didn't Y editor actually canvassed when he called those unrelated admins (admin interven was not required)?? Is it correct to call X editor inexperienced newbie when he have done some good works like DYK, FL, GA?? Did X editor used common sense??

Even though you told me to wait a month or two, I simply couldn't wait that long not knowing if I could have gotten rollback sooner. I now have more than <a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/supercount/index.php?user=VeNeMousKAT&amp;project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;toplimit=10'>200 edits to mainspace</a> (article) and have <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:VeNeMousKAT/CVUA'>completed my CVUA</a>!

When I first joined Wikipedia, I didn't realize the beauty of Wikipedia. I didn't realize how fun it is to revert and interact with people on Wikipedia.

I have found Wikipedia to be a very fun place ever since I've been unblocked and I never intend to hurt/disrupt Wikipedia again.

The CVUA taught me a lot about counter vandalism and how to deal with other issues involving edit waring to dealing with users.<br><br><b>Why I want, and what I intend to do with rollback</b><br><br>I want rollback for the simple reason being that rollback is more effective, faster, and more efficient way to stop, and neutralize vandalism. I intend to use rollback rights so I can revert vandalism (and only that with rollback) with Stiki and/or Huggle, two very effective anti-vandalism programs.<br><br><b>Why you, and the community should trust me</b><br><br>I believe you, and the community, should trust me because I now work hard to revert and/or remove vandalism and help improve Wikipedia. I have 200 mainspace edits now, compared to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?&amp;oldid=622436794#User:VeNeMousKAT'>75</a> I had when I requested it before.

            "html": "Hello, requesting guidance for a proposed edit to the Kevin Mitnick page. I noticed that you mentioned that 'Kevin Mitnick is an American convicted felon' normally wouldn't be noted in the first line of the article, UNLESS this is what the subject is known for. The rationale for this edit came from using the Frank Abagnale article as a model (Abagnale even wrote a promotional blurb for Mitnick's published autobiography), and from the fact that this is indeed what Mitnick is most famous for. See a simple Google image search resulting in his wanted posters, as well as the fact that he promotes his 'most wanted' status himself to position himself in his current field. Given this information, would it be inappropriate to make such an edit in the opening line of the article? — Preceding <a href='./Wikipedia:Signatures' title='Wikipedia:Signatures'>unsigned</a> comment added by <a href='./User:Boorsours' title='User:Boorsours'>Boorsours</a> (<a href='./User_talk:Boorsours' title='User talk:Boorsours'>talk</a> • <a href='./Special:Contributions/Boorsours' title='Special:Contributions/Boorsours'>contribs</a>)<br><br> <a href='./Template:Reply' title='Template:Reply'>Template:Reply</a> The <a href='./MOS:BLPLEAD' title='MOS:BLPLEAD'>first sentence</a> generally states the name and occupation, or why they are notable.

In less than 72 hours, the competition will begin! Before you all start reviewing nominations we want to make sure you understand the following:<ul><li>This is a friendly competition so we don't want any cheating/breaking of the rules. However, if you do believe someone is going against the rules, notify the judges. All the rules are listed <a href='./Wikipedia:WikiProject_Good_articles/GA_Cup/Scoring' title='Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/GA Cup/Scoring'>here</a>.</li><li>If you are a new editor or new to reviewing Good article nominations, it is imperative that you read the 4 essays/guides listed under <a href='./Wikipedia:WikiProject_Good_articles/GA_Cup/FAQ' title='Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/GA Cup/FAQ'>FAQ #4</a>. If you do not understand something, ask a judge for clarification ASAP!</li><li>The competition is not entirely about who can review the most nominations. Per the '<a href='./Wikipedia:WikiProject_Good_articles/GA_Cup/Scoring' title='Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/GA Cup/Scoring'>Scoring</a>' page, there is different criteria in which you can earn more points. Theoretically, you could review 10 nominations and have 80 points but another user could have reviewed 5 nominations and have 100 points. Yes, we want you to review as many nominations as you can as this will greatly increase the number of points you earn, but you must also keep in mind that <b>every single review</b> will be looked over by a judge. If we find that you are 'rubber-stamping' (in other words, the review is not complete but you still passed/failed the article) you may be disqualified without warning.</li></ul>Also, rather than creating a long list on what to remember, make sure you have read the 'Scoring', 'Submissions', and 'FAQ' pages.<br><br>Now for the one question that we guarantee you have: how on earth will the rounds work???<br><br>Yes, we never actually had a solid platform regarding how the rounds would work because we had no idea how many people would sign-up. Even though the competition is about to begin, because sign-ups are still open, it is impossible to say exactly how each round will work. As of now, we can confirm that Round 1 will have everyone compete in one big pool. Depending on the final number of participants after sign-ups close, a to-be-determined number of participants will move on (highest scorers will move on) to Round 2. We guarantee that the top 15 will move on, so make sure you aim for those top positions! Moving on to Round 2, participants will be split into pools of even numbers (for example, every pool will have 6 participants). The pools will be determined by a computer program that places participants by random. More details regarding Round 2 will be sent out at the end of Round 1.<br><br>It is important to note that the GA Cup will run on <a href='./UTC' title='UTC'>UTC</a> time, so make sure you know what time that is for where you live! On that note, the GA Cup will start on <b>October 1 at 0:00:01 UTC</b>; Round 1 will end on <b>October 29 at 23:59:59 UTC</b>; Round 2 will commence on <b>November 1 at 0:00:01 UTC</b>. All reviews must be started <i>after or on</i> the start time of the round. If you qualify for Round 2 but do not complete a review before the end of Round 1, the review can be carried over to Round 2; however that review will not count for Round 1. Prior to the start of the second round, participants who qualify to move on will be notified.<br><br>Finally, if you know anyone else that might be interesting in participating, let them know! Sign-ups close on October 15 so there is still plenty of time to join in on the action!<br><br>If you have any further questions, contact one of the judges or leave a message <a href='./Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Good_articles/GA_Cup' title='Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Good articles/GA Cup'>here</a>.<br><br><i>On October 16 or 17, 2014, check the <a href='./Wikipedia:WikiProject_Good_articles/GA_Cup/Pools/Round_1' title='Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/GA Cup/Pools/Round 1'>Pools</a> page as we will post the exact number of participants that will move on to the next round. Because this number will be determined past the halfway mark of Round 1, we encourage you to aim to be in the top 15 as the top 15 at the end of the round are guaranteed to move on.</i><br><br>Cheers from <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NickGibson3900'>NickGibson3900</a>, <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dom497'>Dom497</a>, <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TheQ_Editor'>TheQ Editor</a> and  <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Figureskatingfan'>Figureskatingfan</a>.<br><br>To subscribe or unsubscribe to future GA Cup newsletter, please add or remove your name to <a href='./Wikipedia:WikiProject_Good_articles/GA_Cup/Newsletter/Send' title='Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/GA Cup/Newsletter/Send'>our mailing list</a>.

For instance, you wrote 'Passionate about education, they offer what they can to help students improve and excel', referring to the teachers. Is this really <i>encyclopedic</i>? What have I learned about the institution? It sounds more like you are trying to convince the reader of how good the teachers are and this a good place to go to school. A similar acceptable example would be, 'so and so news agency rated the teachers to be the best in the school system'. That would attribute the opinion to something <b>previously published</b>, so it's left to the reader how to interpret it, as we aren't implying it to be factual. Finally, your article contained no sources whatsoever. On Wikipedia everything needs to be <a href='./Wikipedia:V' title='Wikipedia:V'>verifiable</a>, attributed with <a href='./Wikipedia:RS' title='Wikipedia:RS'>reliable sources</a>.

Over 80 reviews have been made thus far.  Thank you all for your efforts and for your part in making the GA Cup a success.<br><br>However, this is the inaugural year of the GA Cup, so there have been some unforeseen circumstances that have come up.  One has been a glaring inadequacy with the rules, which the judges feel makes the competition unfair.  As a result, there will be a major change in the rules, starting at the beginning of Round 2:<br><br> <b>Your review must provide feedback/suggestions for improvement, and then you must wait until the nominator has responded and all issues/suggestions have been resolved before you can pass the article. Failure to follow this rule will result in disqualification.</b><br><br>What this means is that you must provide some feedback to the article's nominator, and must wait for him or her to respond before passing the article.  If the nominator has not responded in the standard 7 days, you can fail the article.  We're instituting this rule change to prevent the possibility of competitors passing articles for the sake of passing articles (or failing them) and to gain more points.  We believe that the change will make it more fair to all competitors in the GA Cup.<br><br>Also, in case you haven't noticed, we increased the 'guarantee' for Round 2 to 25 participants. The exact number will be decided in the near future.<br><br>We thank your for your participation, and for your flexibility and understanding as we learn what works and what doesn't work in this competition.<br><br>Cheers from <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NickGibson3900'>NickGibson3900</a>, <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dom497'>Dom497</a>, <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TheQ_Editor'>TheQ Editor</a> and  <a href='//test.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Figureskatingfan'>Figureskatingfan</a>.<br><br>To subscribe or unsubscribe to future GA Cup newsletter, please add or remove your name to <a href='./Wikipedia:WikiProject_Good_articles/GA_Cup/Newsletter/Send' title='Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/GA Cup/Newsletter/Send'>our mailing list</a>.

Use the <a href='./Talk:Democratic_Party_of_Hawaii' title='Talk:Democratic Party of Hawaii'>talk page</a> to discuss your concerns. Instead of trying to control the article, work with others to improve it. Together we can make it more accurate and unbiased, which is our goal as an encyclopedia.

Maybe ask at <a href='./Wikipedia_talk:MED' title='Wikipedia talk:MED'>Wikiproject Medicine</a> if they think your subject is suitable for Wikipedia.

For starters, this is entirely too much information for a biography. It reads like a series of diary entries. Secondly, there are absolutely no sources whatsoever. <a href='./Wikipedia:V' title='Wikipedia:V'>Verifiability</a> is crucial, especially with <a href='./Wikipedia:BLP' title='Wikipedia:BLP'>biographies of living persons</a>. You are also writing in the <a href='./First-person_narrative' title='First-person narrative'>first-person</a>, with a strong <a href='./Wikipedia:PROMO' title='Wikipedia:PROMO'>promotional tone</a>. Frankly all this combined made it seem like vandalism, which is why it keeps getting reverted. Finally, you are <a href='./Wikipedia:AUTOBIO' title='Wikipedia:AUTOBIO'>strongly discouraged</a> to contribute to articles about yourself, as it may be difficult to not exert a <a href='./Wikipedia:COI' title='Wikipedia:COI'>conflict of interest</a>. My advice is to refrain from adding the content, take a step back and try to first grasp what <a href='./Wikipedia:5' title='Wikipedia:5'>Wikipedia is all about</a>. Wikipedia is not a platform to write about and promote yourself. However, if there is something <i>wrong</i> with the article, such as incorrect information, we do want to fix that.
